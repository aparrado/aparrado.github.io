Here are a few things that I've written and done in the past:

* [Right tool, right time: Statistical software at IDinsight](https://medium.com/idinsight-blog/right-tool-right-time-statistical-softwares-at-idinsight-2fef44a1d4c9). Wrote about how we used R, Python, and Stata at IDinsight.

* [Shiny app](https://building1community.shinyapps.io/b1c_asset_mapping/) that shows different resources available for migrant communities in Stamford CT.

* [Coreographed a dance piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-RejKfxeSk) as part of Naacho - Princeton's premier South Asian dance troupe.

* [Engineers Without Borders - Perú](https://ewb.princeton.edu/peru-blog/a-pms-reflections-by-andres-parrado/). Build a gravity-fed water system with a team of Princeton students and community members in Perú.

* [Volunteered in Serbia](https://www.princeton.edu/bridgeyear/updates/serbia/index.xml?id=4215) at two local NGOs for nine months to create awareness about HIV prevention and youth issues.
