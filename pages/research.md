#### <u>Be the Best!: Do SMS Reminders Improve Banking Agent Performance in Rural India? </u> 

 We use three randomized experiments to test whether sending behaviorally-informed SMS reminders to banking agents improves their work performance. In particular, we measure the
effect of these reminders on agents’ efforts at enrolling customers into government pension and
insurance programs in India. The first randomized experiment, with 3,120 banking agents, focused on increasing enrollments in the government’s pension program using three behavioural
framings: appealing to the agents’ personal motivation, appealing to their prosocial motivation,
and threatening that their performance was being closely monitored. We sent these messages
either once or thrice a week. We find that sending SMS reminders thrice a week over a 4-week
period threatening monitoring leads to an average increase of 13.4% in pension enrollments per
agent, an effect that persists two months after we stop sending messages. We used these results
to design the other two experiments, with 3,398 and 1,776 agents working with two banks, to
increase enrollment in the government’s insurance programs. SMS reminders increased enrollment in insurance products too, but only for agents working with one of the two partner banks.
This bank is known for its commitment to financial inclusion. Overall, our results suggest that
SMS reminders can be a cost-effective way to motivate agent performance, but only within a
supportive ecosystem. *With Krishanu Chakraborty and Karan Nagpal.*
